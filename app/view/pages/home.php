<form method="POST" action="/home/submit">
    <input name="url" value="" id="url" /><input name="submit" value="Go" id="convert" type="submit" />
</form>
<p><strong>How to use:</strong> Simply paste the URL that you would like to make shorter into the blue box above and click Go. The website will generate a shorter link for you and display it on screen.</p>
<p><strong>New:</strong> We're now offering an <a href="/api">API</a> for programatically creating shorter URLs. Includes an example in PHP.</p>
